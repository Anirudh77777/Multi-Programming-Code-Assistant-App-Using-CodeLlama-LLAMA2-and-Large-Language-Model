# Multi-Programming-Code-Assistant-App-Using-CodeLlama-LLAMA2-and-Large-Language-Model

# Description
This project is a Python-based application that leverages the power of langchain and gradio to create an interactive, user-friendly interface. The main functionality of the project is encapsulated in the app.py file, while the modelfile contains essential model data or logic required for the application's operation.
# Key Components
LangChain: This library is used for handling language models and processing natural language input, making it a crucial part of the application's backend.
Gradio: A library that enables the creation of easy-to-use web-based interfaces for machine learning models, allowing users to interact with the model directly from their browser.
# Features
Interactive Interface: Users can interact with the application through a web-based interface provided by Gradio.
Natural Language Processing: The application uses LangChain to process and respond to user inputs effectively.
Model Integration: The project integrates pre-trained or custom-trained models to perform specific tasks as defined in the modelfile
